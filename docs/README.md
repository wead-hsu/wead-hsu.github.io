# Weidi Xu

I am a researcher with over 10 years of well-balanced experience in academia and industry. I am now with [Inf](https://www.infly.cn/), a startup company working on large language model solutions for industry applications. I received my Ph.D. from Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. Ying Tan. Before that, I obtained my BS. from South China University of Technology. My current research mainly focuses on logical reasoning, especially neuro-symbolic methods. Previously, I mainly worked on learning latent variable models for NLP problems. We have some research intern positions available in Inf. If you are interested in LLM and logical reasoning, please contact me: wdxu@inftech.ai.
